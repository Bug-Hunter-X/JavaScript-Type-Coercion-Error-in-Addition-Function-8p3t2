# JavaScript Type Coercion Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to type coercion. The `bug.js` file contains a function that attempts to add two numbers. However, it doesn't perform type checking, leading to errors if non-numeric inputs are provided. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with explicit type checking.
